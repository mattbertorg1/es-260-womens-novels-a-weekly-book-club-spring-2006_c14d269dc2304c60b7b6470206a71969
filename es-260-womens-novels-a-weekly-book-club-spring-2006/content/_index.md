This pass/fail seminar should be a fun setting where we can all enjoy a love of good books together. Students will read approximately one novel every two weeks, and the class will discuss each novel in a relaxed and interactive setting, with attention to whatever themes and issues interest them most about each book. We will read a wide mixture of classic and contemporary novels written by women, including: Edith Wharton, _The House of Mirth_; Toni Morrison, _Jazz_; Virginia Woolf, _Mrs. Dalloway_; Alice Walker, _The Color Purple_; Charlotte BrontÃ«, _Jane Eyre_; Sheri Reynolds, _The Rapture of Canaan_; Jane Austen, _Pride and Prejudice_; and Sylvia Plath, _The Bell Jar_. Recurrent issues likely to be discussed include: gender, race, and class; romance, love, and marriage; depression and suicide; and conception, childbirth, and parenthood.
